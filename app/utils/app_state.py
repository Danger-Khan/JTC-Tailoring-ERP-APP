"""Tiny JSON-backed "remember what the user left it on" cache.

Not a database — just a small cache file (app_state_cache.json, in the
data dir's cache/ subfolder) holding the handful of UI preferences that
should survive closing and reopening the app: theme, language, which
sidebar section was open, the display mode, and the window's last
size/position. Read once
on startup, written on every change that matters and again on close, so a
crash mid-session loses at most the very latest tweak, never everything.
